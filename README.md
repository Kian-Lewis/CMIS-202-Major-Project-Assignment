# CMIS-202-Major-Project-Assignment
Major Project Assignment for my Computer Science 2 class.


To access the main .java files go to Library of Alexandria/src/application. Alexandria.java is the main class.

<b><h3>Who Are The Users?</h3></b>

  This program was designed to suit the needs of a light reader who has a small collection of books.
  
<b><h3>What Is The Software's Purpose?</h3></b>

  To record and catalog a reasonable sum of physical books into a library, and then sort them by the author's last names. The program would make it simple to see 
  important attributes of a book such as the genre or total page count.

<b><h3>Where And When Will The Software be Used?  </h3></b>

  This program would ideally be used from the user's home computer, and would be when the user has at least a modest amount of time to spare, as recording a large 
  number of books with this software could potentially be fairly laborious.

<b><h3>Why Would Anyone Use The Software Over Existing Processes? </h3></b>

  Honestly speaking, there isn't anything about this program that would beat out existing library programs in terms of ease of use or featuresets. The program does 
  have a small niche appeal of having no ebook shop or links to books that the user does not own, which as far as I am aware is near ubiquitous with library 
  programs, everyone wants to sell you something. The fact that this program does not do this(yet) could be a niche selling point of it for someone who absolutely 
  cannot tolerate advertisement.
