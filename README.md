Major Project Assignment for my Computer Science 2 class.


To access the main .java files go to Library of Alexandria/src/application. Alexandria.java is the main class.

<b><h1<Who Are The Users?</h1></b>

  This program was designed to suit the needs of a light reader who has a small collection of books.
  
What Is The Software's Purpose?

  To record and catalog a reasonable sum of physical books into a library, and then sort them by the author's last names. The program would make it simple to see 
  important attributes of a book such as the genre or total page count.

Where And When Will The Software be Used?  

  This program would ideally be used from the user's home computer, and would be when the user has at least a modest amount of time to spare, as recording a large 
  number of books with this software could potentially be fairly laborious.

Why Would Anyone Use The Software Over Existing Processes?

  Honestly speaking, there isn't anything about this program that would beat out existing library programs in terms of ease of use or featuresets. The program does 
  have a small niche appeal of having no ebook shop or links to books that the user does not own, which as far as I am aware is near ubiquitous with library 
  programs, everyone wants to sell you something. The fact that this program does not do this(yet) could be a niche selling point of it for someone who absolutely 
  cannot tolerate advertisement.
